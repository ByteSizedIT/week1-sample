# Project Report 

## Intro
We have built a microblogging application. This has been built dynamically and created to run on a server. Users can submit their username and a post, read other users' posts and delete posts.

This was built to put into practice the topics covered in the first week of Founders and Coders' full time course- Express, Node.js, nodemon, Cypress.

## Project Scope
We are not building an application that has a character limit or enables commenting under other users' posts.  At present, the app allows you to post a message but not interact with others. This is a possible stretch goal to improve the user experience.

We decided which features would be most important to implement by focusing on the user journey and ensuring the appliation has sufficient functionality. 

## Project Plan
We started by initialising the repository and setting up the server. 

We then divided the work and worked individually. When the structure of the application came together, we moved onto functionality. At this stage, we began paired-programing to tackle bugs and issues, moved onto styling and finally, testing.

## Requirement Analysis
We ran a lighthouse test to get a report on how responsive and accessible our application is. Issues were then created according to what needed to be improved. 

## Project Learnings
Code reviews addressed some helpful issues regarding accessibility. We reviewed our labels following the issues raised.

Our team was supportive, helpful and we communicated well.

##Â Recommendations and conclusions
We could dedicate more time to testing as this was the last thing we worked on and we ran into a few errors (which were addressed!)

The project was successful- the app is functional and we all learned a lot on the way :D
